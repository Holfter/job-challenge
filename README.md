<h1>About the project:</h1>
<p>The project was for a photovoltaic energy company. I had to build a graph to show information from a day of production for a photovoltaic plant. The user can choose the option he wants to show on the graph, being power, voltage, current or temperature. In addition, I created a CRUD, which lists all the company's customers. User can add, update and delete a customer.</p>
